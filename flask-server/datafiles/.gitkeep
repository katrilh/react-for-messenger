Put all facebook msg folders in this folder


> subfolders like photos/gifs/ect.. can be deleted
> The files that will be loaded are called message_n.json, 
    n = 1 at the first iteration

The file must have the following json fields:

{
    "title": "", 
    "messages": [
        {
        "sender_name": "",
        "timestamp_ms": <int>,
        "type": ""
        },
        {
        "sender_name": "",
        "timestamp_ms": <int>,
        "type": ""
        },
        ...
    ]
}

NB! ONLY paste the folders of chats which you wish to analyze here,
the app will load all chats at once
