which can be put into `fileloader.ts`

# You will get the full list in alldirs.txt,
# just remove that file itself and this one (helperfile.py),
# and youre good to go

def main():
    names = os.listdir('src/datafiles')
    with open("src/datafiles/alldirs.txt", "w") as f:
        for n in names:
            f.write(f"'{n}', \n")
